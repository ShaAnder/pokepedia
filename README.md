This is a small react based project built to emulate the pokemon pokedex website as shown here, in it's current stages it's just
a small demo but will eventually expand to include all functionality in a mock setting. I chose this as both a fan of pokemon and 
that i find the website design fun and interesting and something id love to build utilizing what I have learnt so far in react

THIS IS 100% a student project and as such is soley designed with learning in mind.
